# Bible Study CLI

This command-line app is for people like me who prefer to study the bible with a command-line-interface. I would appreciate suggestions of easy ways to make this more user-friendly.

If you prefer a free web interface, I recommend https://www.stepbible.org with the ESV translation.  Like this, there are no commentaries, but it has many easily viewed cross-references and Greek and Hebrew helps.

All Scripture quotations, unless otherwise indicated, are taken from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version. Copyright Â©2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.
