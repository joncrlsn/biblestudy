# Mind-Renewal Bible Study CLI

This command-line app was written to help me renew my mind to truths in scripture by studying the bible with a command-line-interface.

For most people, instead of this app, I would recommend the free https://www.stepbible.org with the ESV translation.  Like this, there are no commentaries, but it has many easily viewed cross-references and Greek and Hebrew helps.

All Scripture quotations, unless otherwise indicated, are taken from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version. Copyright Â©2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.
